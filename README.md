In this reposetory you will find multiple machine learning and deep learning algorithms implemented, each with a different unique project or mini project (depend on the algorithm itself).

The structure of this repository is, inside the Projects folder you will find multiple projects with the name of the algorithm used, inside you will find the project files with the project name on them.

Here is a list of algorithms and projects implemented so far:
    - Linear Regression : Salary Prediction
    - Logistic Regression : Employee Attrition Prediction
    - Decision Trees : Credit Card Fraud Detection
    - Random Forests : Credit Risk Analysis
    - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) : ecommendation System with Collaborative Filtering
